This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: panicking due to accessing an index out of bounds in a vector. The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code, which attempts to access an element at an index beyond the vector's bounds.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that safely handles potential out-of-bounds access.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling when working with vectors in Rust.
